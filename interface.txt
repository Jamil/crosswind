Argument 1, 2: Origin and Destination Airports 
    The origin and destination airports can either be specified as a whitespace-delimited list, or as a file with the aiport names on individual lines. Crosswind will search for the cartesian product of the origin and destination airports; that is, every possible combination of origin and destination specified. This means that |origin| x |destination| paths will be checked.

SFO SJC OAK LAX to JFK LGA MIA PBI FLL ORD


Argument 3: Outbound and Inbound Dates
    These are the dates you would like to leave on, both from your origin city and your destination city. Make sure they do not overlap, as we're not yet smart enough to make sure that the outbound and inbound dates make sense.

from 03/04/2015 03/05/2015 03/06/2015 until 03/14/2015 03/15/2015 03/16/2015


Argument 4: Advanced Routing Codes
    Standard ITA routing codes; ensure that these codes work for all the routes you specify. For example, although the code "AA ORD AA" would work for some of the routes in the above example, it would not work for any of the trips ending in ORD.

routing "AA,US PHX AA,US / f bc=V|bc=W"


Argument 5: Target CPM
    This is the `target` cost per mile; if a fare meets this CPM (i.e., if the cost divided by the miles flown is less than the target), Twilio will send the destination phone a text.

target 0.10


Argument 6: Phone number 
    This is the phone number to text if the Target CPM is matched. Make sure to set your Twilio API keys and origin phone number in the source (the API keys can also be set with environment variables)

text 3455555555
