Argument 1, 2: Origin and Destination Airports 
    The origin and destination airports can either be specified as a whitespace-delimited list, or
    as a file with the aiport names on individual lines. Crosswind will search for the cartesian
    product of the origin and destination airports; that is, every possible combination of origin
    and destination specified. This means that |origin| x |destination| requests will be made.

--origin SFO SJC OAK LAX --destination JFK LGA MIA PBI FLL ORD
--origin origin_airports.txt -destination destination_airports.txt


Argument 3: Advanced Routing Codes
    Standard ITA routing codes; ensure that these codes work for all the routes you specify. For
    example, although the code "AA ORD AA" would work for some of the routes in the above example,
    it would not work for any of the trips ending in ORD.

--routing "AA,US PHX AA,US / f bc=V|bc=W"


Argument 4: Date Range
    Exactly how you'd think it would work, specify the flexibility of the date, either exact,
    +/- 1, +/- 2, or a calendar of monthly dates. Monthly can take a *long* time to process,
    since we follow through the links for each date in the month.

--date {exact, +-1, +-2, month} 12/31/2015


Argument 5: Class
--class {first, business, economy}


Argument 6: Polling Frequency (in seconds)
    This is how often we examine a new origin-destination pair.
